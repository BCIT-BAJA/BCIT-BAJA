add test points for power-rails and comm ports
add power switch with integrated LED
replace load switch with mosfet
add series and pull-ups on SPI bus(open drain)
choose and add in capacitor at differential strain gauge voltage(maybe)
choose and add capacitor near strain gauge VCC
choose battery holder, put specification of batteries in kicad
change load switch to mosfet
add mosfet switch to every sensor


Goals for today:

choose mosfets to switching
choose capacitors for VCC_strain gauge
