add test points for power-rails and comm ports
add power switch with integrated LED
replace load switch with mosfet
add series and pull-ups on SPI bus(open drain)
choose and add in capacitor at differential strain gauge voltage(maybe)
choose and add capacitor near strain gauge VCC
choose battery holder, put specification of batteries in kicad
change load switch to mosfet
add mosfet switch to every sensor
review current mosfet choices
review current capacitor choices

Goals for today:

choose mosfets to switching
choose capacitors for VCC_strain gauge

Result - By 03-16

Both mosfet will not be added into circuit. Both IMU and ANTENNA have sleep mode, which is in the micro to milliamp current usage range. Add in
capacitor will optimize the system slighty, however the complexity of the problem is high. So I have opted to accept the uncertainty of the measurements.

Capacitor. Placement of capacitor is not accross differential. But we need 1 cap for each AIN, in addition to this, our switching frequency
will be varied significantly due to our battery range. This is very complicated stuff to size for. So in terms of time, it may be best to not add this in.
