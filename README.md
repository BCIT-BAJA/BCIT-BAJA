# Problem 
During the last BAJA competition, suspension of the car broke due to the inability to measure dynamic forces applied onto the suspension as a result, during the last competition, it bent.

The telemetry system for BCIT-BAJA, collects strain across suspension components of car to allow BAJA to optimize material and reinforce weak areas of suspension.
As well as collect other data such as linear/angular acceleration.

There consists of 2 parts of this project. 
# PART A the amplification of the (0-15mV) to (0-3.0V) analog strain gauge signal which is then routed to
# PART B, the collection of the 8 conditioned analog signals which is then transmitted and received over a 900MHz antenna


# MAINBOARD( PART A)
