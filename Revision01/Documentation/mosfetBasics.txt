Vds -  source break down voltage
Vin < Vds we want Vds as high as possible.
Vgs - turns on mosfet. Vgs < Vthresh to turn on 
As Id increases, so does vgs usually.
So what Id do we have? What Vds do we have
From there we have a specific Vgs we can see from the datasheet
Id - continuous drain current. Max current. Varies with temperature.
Rds(on) - resistance between drain and source.
Idss - drain leakage current
iDM - peak drain current.
